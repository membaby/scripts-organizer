# Scripts Organizer

## Overview
The **Scripts Organizer** is a Python-based tool designed to help manage and organize various scripts. Whether youâ€™re dealing with large collections of scripts or simply need an efficient way to group and categorize them, this tool provides a streamlined solution.

## Features
- Organize scripts by type, functionality, or custom categories.
- Automatically group scripts based on file extensions.
- Create directories for categorized scripts for better accessibility.
- Easy to extend for additional organization logic.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Required Python libraries:
  - `os`
  - `shutil`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/membaby/scripts-organizer.git
   cd scripts-organizer
   ```

2. Ensure Python is installed on your system. Verify the version:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

3. Install additional dependencies (if needed).

## Usage
1. Place the scripts you want to organize in the designated folder or specify the directory in the script.
2. Run the `scripts_organizer.py` file:
   ```bash
   python scripts_organizer.py
   ```
3. Organized scripts will be moved into categorized directories within the specified location.

### Customization
- **Change categories:**
  Update the categorization logic in the script to group scripts based on your specific needs, such as by:
  - Programming language (e.g., `.py`, `.js`, `.sh`).
  - Purpose (e.g., `data_analysis`, `automation`).

- **Destination directory:**
  Modify the script to change the default directory where organized scripts are saved.

## Code Structure
1. **File categorization:**
   The script scans a directory for files and organizes them based on predefined rules (e.g., file extension).

2. **Directory creation:**
   Creates subdirectories for each category if they do not exist.

3. **File movement:**
   Moves each file to its corresponding directory.

## Example
If the input folder contains:
```
data_analysis.py
automation_tool.sh
web_scraper.js
```
After running the script, the directory might look like:
```
organized_scripts/
  Python/
    data_analysis.py
  Shell_Scripts/
    automation_tool.sh
  JavaScript/
    web_scraper.js
```
